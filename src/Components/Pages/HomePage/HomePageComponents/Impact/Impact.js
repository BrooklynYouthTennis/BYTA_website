            The Brooklyn Youth Tennis Association (BYTA), a not-for-profit organization, opens a new door for many inner-city boys and girls, ages 7-18, to learn the game of tennis. We enroll about 1,000 students during the school year and 150-300 in our summer program.

            At BYTA, we insist on academic achievement and offer educational support. The average GPA of our participants is 3.1 (2.0 or higher GPA is required to remain in the program).

            90% of our participants earn a high school diploma, compared to the 67% of students who graduate from high school citywide and only 51% in Brooklyn.

            25% earn tennis scholarships to leading colleges
            65% receive non-athletic financial aid
            60% attend college at leading private and public institutions
